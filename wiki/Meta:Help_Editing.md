The wiki syntax is Markdown with a few additions:

* \[\[term\]\] links to the article with title term.
* \!\[image_file\]\! shows the local image file /images/image_file on the right column of the wiki at the height it was written.
* Math formulas in Tex or other syntaxes (check the [Mathjax](//mathjax.org) site). Omit the spaces.
    * $ $ math $ $ for math on a second line.
    * \ \ ( math \ \ ) for inline math.
